# ‚öôÔ∏è Forte Rules Engine ‚Äì Local Development Guide with Anvil

This guide provides a step-by-step process for integrating, deploying, and testing smart contracts using the **Forte Rules Engine (FRE)** in a local **Anvil** development environment with the **Forte Rules Engine SDK**.

---

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) (`forge`, `anvil`, etc.)
- Node.js & npm
- TypeScript (`tsx` or `ts-node`)
- RPC URL and Private Key for transaction broadcasting
- Forte Rules Engine SDK
- `anvilState.json` file with predeployed FRE & OFAC contract

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. üß© Integrate & Deploy the Example Contracts

#### Inject modifiers into contracts:
```bash
npx tsx index.ts injectModifiers ./policies/kyc-level.json ../src/KYCRulesEngineIntegration.sol ../src/Register.sol
```

#### Deploy the `Register` contract:
```bash
forge script ../script/Register.s.sol --ffi --broadcast -vvv --non-interactive --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIV_KEY
```

Set your contract address:
```bash
REGISTER_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
```

---

### 2. üõ°Ô∏è Deploy the KYC Contract

```bash
forge script ../script/KYC.s.sol --ffi --broadcast -vvv --non-interactive --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIV_KEY
```

Set your contract address:
```bash
KYC_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
```

Update ForeignCalls KYC address in kyc-level.json with KYC_ADDRESS

---

### 3. üìú Create Policies in the Rules Engine

#### Create the Reward Policy:
```bash
npx tsx index.ts setupPolicy policies/reward.json
```
```bash
REWARD_POLICY_ID=<returned_policy_id>
```

#### Create the KYC Level Policy:
```bash
npx tsx index.ts setupPolicy policies/kyc-level.json
```
```bash
KYC_POLICY_ID=<returned_policy_id>
```

---

### 4. üîó Link Rules Engine to Register Contract

#### Set the Rules Engine address:
```bash
cast send $REGISTER_ADDRESS "setRulesEngineAddress(address)" $RULES_ENGINE_ADDRESS --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIV_KEY
```

#### Verify the address was set:
```bash
cast call $REGISTER_ADDRESS "rulesEngineAddress()(address)" --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

---

### 5. üë§ Set Calling Contract Admin

```bash
cast send $REGISTER_ADDRESS "setCallingContractAdmin(address)" $USER_ADDRESS_1 --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIV_KEY
```

---

### 6. üì¨ Subscribe the Contract to Policies

```bash
npx tsx index.ts applyPolicy $REWARD_POLICY_ID $CONTRACT_ADDRESS
npx tsx index.ts applyPolicy $KYC_POLICY_ID $CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

---

### 7. üßæ Sanctions Check with Included FRE Adapter

The included `anvilState.json` contains the OFAC Sanctions Adapter at:

```text
0x0B306BF915C4d645ff596e518fAf3F9669b97016
```

You can verify a user's status:
```bash
cast call $FRE_OFAC_SACTIONS_CONTRACT "isDenied(address)(bool)" $USER_ADDRESS_3 --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

---

## ‚úÖ KYC + Register Flow

### Set KYC Level to 3
```bash
cast send $KYC_CONTRACT "setKycLevel(address,uint256)" $USER_ADDRESS_1 3 --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIV_KEY
```

### Get KYC Level
```bash
cast call $KYC_CONTRACT "getKycLevel(address)(uint256)" $USER_ADDRESS_1 --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

### Get KYC Timestamp
```bash
cast call $KYC_CONTRACT "getKycTimestamp(address)(uint256)" $USER_ADDRESS_1 --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

---

## üí∏ Example Registers

### ‚úÖ Successful register (KYC'd User)
```bash
cast send $REGISTER_ADDRESS "transfer(address,uint256)" $USER_ADDRESS_1 40000 --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIV_KEY
```

### ‚ùå Failed register (User Not KYC'd)
```bash
cast send $REGISTER_ADDRESS "transfer(address,uint256)" $USER_ADDRESS_2 40000 --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIV_KEY
```

---

## üìÅ Notes

- Ensure `$RPC_URL`, `$PRIV_KEY`, and all contract addresses are set correctly before executing commands.
- The `anvilState.json` file must match the expected contract addresses (e.g., FRE and OFAC adapter).
